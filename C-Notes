1> Static variable : The variable which gets defined when encountered for the 1st time and next time onwards same variable is used. 

void a()
{
	static int s = 0;
	printf("S:%d\n",s++);
}

2> Volatile variable : The variable which doesn't allow compiler to optimize the variable in any sense.

3> Global variable : Variable declared outside any blog is called global as it is accessible from anywhere in the file.

4> Constant : using keyword const, It is not allowed to change the value of const variable. But using address and pointers we can change its value. for e.g. 

	const int a =0;
	int *p = &a;
	*p = 123;

5> Register variable : If we use register keyword before variable, it tells compiler to access the variable as quickly as possible. Variable value is stored in CPU register which provides max. speed.
